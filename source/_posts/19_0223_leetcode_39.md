## Description

https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/

Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target), find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

<!--more-->
The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.

Note:

All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example 1:

    Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
    A solution set is:
    [
      [7],
      [2,2,3]
    ]

Example 2:

    Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
    A solution set is:
    [
      [2,2,2,2],
      [2,3,3],
      [3,5]
    ]

## Solution

### Expalnation:

- Sort the list at first, so once the remain less than 0, it doesn't have to add next numbers of the list.
- The process of addition likes deep first sort.

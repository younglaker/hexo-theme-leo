## Description

https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.


<!--more-->
Example 1:

    Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
    Output: [2]

Example 2:

    Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
    Output: [9,4]

Note:

- Each element in the result must be unique.
- The result can be in any order.

## Solution 1: Hash(Dictionary)

```
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums1, nums2):
        dict1 = {}
        dict2 = {}
        result = []
        for i in nums1:
            dict1[i] = 0

        for i in nums2:
            dict2[i] = 0

        for key, value in dict1.items():

            # has_key has been deprecated in Python 3.0
            if key in dict2:
                result.append(key)

        return result
```

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n+m)


## Solution 2: Set

A little tricky in python, we can use `set`, but the idea is the same as hash table.

```
class Solution:
    def singleNumber2(self, nums1, nums2):
        set1 = set(nums1)
        set2 = set(nums2)
        return list(set2 & set1)
```

- Time complexity : O(n+m) in the average case and O(n×m) in the worst case when load factor is high enough.
- Space complexity : O(n+m) in the worst case when all elements in the arrays are different.

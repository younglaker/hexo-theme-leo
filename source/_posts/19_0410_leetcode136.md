<!-- ![LeetCode 189 Rotate Array](https://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/6d184cefgy1g008qty954j20p0046aaf.jpg) -->


## Description

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

<!--more-->
Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

    Input: [2,2,1]
    Output: 1

Example 2:

    Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
    Output: 4




## Solution:

https://github.com/younglaker/leetcode/blob/master/38_Count_and_Say.py

### Approach 1 - Array

```
def singleNumber1(nums):
    list = []
    for i in nums:
        if i in list:
            list.remove(i)
        else:
            list.append(i)
    return list.pop()
```

Use array(in Python called list) to store numbers in nums. If some number in `nums` is new to array, append it.If some number is already in the array, remove it

- Time complexity : O(n^2). `for i in nums` takes O(n) time, and `if i in list` is also a for-loop taking O(n) time.
- Space complexity : O(n). We need a list of size n to contain elements in nums.


### Approach 2 - Hash

```
def singleNumber2(nums):
    dict = {}
    for i in nums:
        if dict.has_key(i):
            dict.pop(i)
        else:
            dict.update({i: 0})
    print dict
    for key, val in dict.items():
        if val == 0:
            return key
```

or:

```
def singleNumber5(nums):
    hash_table = {}
    for i in nums:
        try:
            hash_table.pop(i)
        except:
            hash_table[i] = 1
    # popitem(): Remove the last item from the dictionary:
    return hash_table.popitem()[0]
```

Use array(in Python called list) to store numbers in nums. If some number in `nums` is new to array, append it.If some number is already in the array, remove it

- Time complexity : O(n). `for i in nums` takes O(n) time, and `if dict.has_key(i)` takes O(1) time.
- Space complexity : O(n). We need a hash table of size n to contain elements in nums.

### Approach 3: Math

```
def singleNumber3(nums):
    # sum(a)
    # a is the list , it adds up all the numbers in the
    # list a and takes start to be 0, so returning
    # only the sum of the numbers in the list.
    # sum(a, start)
    # this returns the sum of the list + start
    # set(list): remove the duplicate
    return 2 * sum(set(nums)) - sum(nums)
```

2∗(a+b+c)−(2a+2b+c)=c

- Time complexity : O(n + n) = O(2n)=O(n). `sum()` is a for-loop.
- Space complexity : O(n + n) = O(2n)=O(n). A set needs space for the elements in nums

### Approach 4: XOR

Because `a⊕0=a` and `a⊕a=0`
Then: `a⊕b⊕a=(a⊕a)⊕b=0⊕b=b`
So we can XOR all bits together to find the unique number.

```
def singleNumber4(nums):
    a = 0
    for i in nums:
        a ^= i
    return a
```
